# Iris Recognition Project

Description: This classifier model will predict the Iris flower based on sepal
length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (all in cm). There are three different classes:
Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica.

Interactive Web App: https://matiaslin.shinyapps.io/irisRecognition/

#

There are 150 data points, 50 for each class.
